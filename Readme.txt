Covid Deaths & Vaccination Analysis SQL ProjectProject OverviewProject Title: Covid Deaths & Vaccination AnalysisLevel: BeginnerThis project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze Covid data. The project involves setting up a Covid database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) through SQL queries. Objectives1. Set up a Covid Deaths & Vaccination database: Create and populate a Covid Deaths & Vaccination database.2. Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values and eliminate the ones that are not necessary.3. Data Analysis: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.Project Structure1. Database Setup* Database Creation: The project starts by creating databases named Deaths & Vaccination.* Table Creation: A table named CovidDeaths & CovidVaccination is created to store the data. The table structure includes columns for respective tables.2. Data Exploration & Cleaning* The dataset used in this project focuses on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different regions and countries.* Death Count: Find out how many people died due to Covid-19 as per country and continent* Vaccination Count: Find out how many people were vaccinated * New Vaccination: Find out how many new vaccinations were done across different regions and countries.* Infection Rate: Find out how many people contracted Covid-19* Projection: Project the percentage in the chosen countries if the Covid-19 cases goes up.* Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.3. Data Analysis & Findings* Worldwide Effects:There were more than 150 million COVID-19 cases, and the death rate was about 2.11%.At almost 800,000 each, Europe and North America had the largest mortality tolls.* Vaccination Development:Worldwide, more than 135 billion doses of vaccines were given.13.34% was the average worldwide immunisation rate.With almost 97% of its people immunised, China was the leader in immunisation campaigns.* Trends by Region:Infection rates were higher in North America, Europe, and South America than in Africa and Oceania.With estimates indicating a surge of 19%, the United States has one of the highest infection rates.Infection rates were far lower in Nepal than in Western nations.* Differences in VaccinationThe two regions with the highest new vaccination rates were Asia and Europe.With a far lower immunisation rate, Africa trailed behind other continents in terms of vaccine efforts.
